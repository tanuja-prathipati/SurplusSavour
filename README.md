The web application fosters a connection between those willing to
donate surplus food and those in need of receiving it. Donors, will
specify designated time slots when surplus food is available for
collection. It provides details on food availability, to the registered
users who are in need when food is ready for collection. The
initiative is non-profit, aiming to minimize food wastage and provide
free meals to those in need.
